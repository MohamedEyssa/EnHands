We are thrilled to share some exciting news! EnHands has been awarded a generous grant of €2,500 from CeTI - the Centre for Tactile Internet with Human-in-the Loop at TU Dresden.

This funding comes as a major boost to our mission of making affordable hand prostheses for those in need.

Thanks to CeTI’s contribution, we will be able to travel to Nepal and conduct a pilot study with our current prototypes. We’ll be evaluating our prostheses with the local Nepalese population. This experience in Nepal gives us real-world insights and helps us ensure that our prostheses are not only functional but also culturally appropriate.

The grant from CeTI will be primarily used to cover our Nepal trip expenses, including flights and other travel-related costs from Munich to Bardibas, Nepal.

We want to thank CeTI for believing in our vision and providing us with this generous support. We look forward to sharing more updates on our progress and the impact of this grant.
