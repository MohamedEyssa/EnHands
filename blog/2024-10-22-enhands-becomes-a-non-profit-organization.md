We’re happy to share the latest news. As of Q3 2024, EnHands has officially become a registered non-profit organization, known in Germany as a gemeinnützlicher eingetragener Verein (e.V.). This is a huge milestone for us and opens up new opportunities to continue our mission of developing affordable and accessible hand prostheses for those in need.

## Why Did We Become an e.V.?
By becoming an e.V., we now have the legal status to operate as an independent legal entity. This means we can enter into contracts, secure funding more easily, and work within a more structured framework. It will help us expand our reach, build stronger partnerships, and hopefully have a greater impact on the communities we serve.
The official process kicked off in August 2024 at a founding meeting held at Sonja’s place. We reviewed our statutes, made final adjustments, and voted on our board members. With the board now in place, and all legal documents signed, we’re fully registered! 

Our Mission: At EnHands, our goal is to develop innovative, locally producible prosthetic concepts and offer them free of charge to our partners and international NGOs. These partners handle the distribution to those in need, ensuring that the prostheses reach people who might otherwise not have access. We’re dedicated to promoting public health and welfare, as well as supporting development cooperation around the world.

Our work focuses on:
* Creating and manufacturing prosthetic concepts for individuals with limb amputations.
* Collaborating with both local and international partners to distribute the prosthetics.
* Raising awareness through events, blog posts, and social media about the challenges faced by those with limb amputations.

How You Can Help: If you’d like to support our mission, any donations would be greatly appreciated. You can contribute to our cause by sending any amount to our bank account. Please contact us for more information.

We’re so excited about this new chapter and can’t wait to continue helping those in need!
