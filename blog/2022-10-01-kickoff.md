We had our kickoff workshop to get EnHands started!
After meeting every few weeks for the last months to get a first idea and organization
for our group, we held a **full-day kickoff event** to get EnHands started.

We brainstormed about our goals as a group and our hand design priorities, decided on our organizational structure and formed several teams: Technical, Organization, Marketing and Finance. Since we are still a small student group, most people are of course part of more than one team.

We discussed organization questions with everyone, such as how we would organize weekly meetings from now on and how we would vote on questions if we couldn't find a concensus. We then had more detailed discussions in the individual teams, talking about the planned mechanical work, potential funding sources, and planning posters and our student fair stand in the marketing team, and afterwards presented the results to each others.
